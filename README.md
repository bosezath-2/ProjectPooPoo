# ProjectPooPoo
Welcome to Project: PooPoo

Introduction:
  
  I made this project because I would like to try several things to enhance the Poopoo experience
With cyberpunk 2077 technologies that make you poopoo faster so you can have less pain at your
Anus. But there are many side effects, Such as: Headache, Brain cancer, Intestinal cancer, Infections inside your Intestines.
You have been warned.

Instructions:

You take the Source code, And upload it to your local Cyberpunk 2077 store, today our Code only supports XLM 950 Version of your Power-up Chips.
Your Power-up Chip must have a Body Adapter, or else you'll have the Side effects. And now find your Chip-Inserter, And put the Adapter (not the body one) On your Chip-Inserter.
And try not to panic, Beyond this step, We have warned you that you should Get someone to help you insert it, or else it would be very challenging and has a bad side effects, Including Diarrhoea to death. The location you need to insert it at is around your back. Near the Spinal cords, And wire each Nerve Cords Accordingly to the Instructions your XLM 950 Version of the Power-up Chip said, WARNING: YOU SHOULD INJECT A ANESTHETIC OR ANYTHING THAT CAN ENDURE YOUR PAIN FIRST, IT IS VERY PAINFUL.
